/* Derives the site's brand assets from the delivered artwork in
 * public/brand. Re-run after replacing any of the source PNGs:

 * Sources (left as delivered, never edited):
 *   AI-ROBOTICS.png         white lockup, for the graphite header and footer
 *   AI-ROBOTICS_Symbol.png  the A mark on its own, for the app icons
 *
 * Both arrive on a generous transparent canvas — the wordmark's ink is 71% of
 * its height, the symbol's 52%. Used raw they would render a third smaller
 * than the box they sit in, so everything here is trimmed to the ink first
 * and padded back deliberately.
 *
 * sharp gotcha: .extend() is applied AFTER .resize() no matter where it sits
 * in the chain, so a resize-then-pad in one pipeline silently produces the
 * wrong size. Each icon is therefore composited onto a canvas in a second
 * pass, via toBuffer().

 * The tab icon is transparent, so it sits on the browser's own chrome rather
 * than in a white chip. The mark is 56% amber and 44% navy, and each theme
 * softens one of them — amber is 6.7:1 on a dark tab against navy's 1.8:1,
 * and the reverse on a light one. The amber A carries the shape either way.
 * It also runs nearly to the edge: at 16px every pixel counts.
 *
 * The Apple touch icon can do neither. iOS composites a transparent one onto
 * black, which would erase the navy, and masks it with a rounded rectangle of
 * roughly 22% corner radius — and the mark's widest points are its two lower
 * corners, exactly what that mask cuts. So: white ground, real margin. */
